# ATLAS Stage 1 & 2 Decisions Log

This document records the major architectural and product decisions established. These decisions are binding for future implementation stages.

## Stage 1: Core Product & Navigation
1. The 20-module navigation structure is strictly frozen.
2. The `Home` module is the default launch page and serves as the operational command center.
3. The platform's layout is a desktop-first, information-dense terminal environment.
4. Custom backgrounds and watermarks are a native part of the UX.

## Stage 1: Architecture
5. ATLAS will begin as a clean **modular monolith**. Microservices are deferred until scale demands them.
6. Python is the primary language for backend, analytics, AI, and business logic.
7. React/Next.js (with TypeScript) is the expected stack for the browser UI.
8. The **Universal Entity architecture** is foundational.
9. **Global Context** is foundational.
10. The **Shared Capability Layer** ensures that core functions are implemented once.
11. A persistent, sandboxed bottom terminal is part of the core product.
12. Settings exist at Global, Section, Workspace, and Widget levels.

## Stage 1: Intelligence & Capabilities
13. The ATLAS AI overlay and the AI Assistant module are distinct surfaces.
14. God's Eye/Maps is a financial and geopolitical intelligence system.

## Stage 1: Agents & Workflows
15. Agents operate as a first-class top-level module within ATLAS.
16. The Agents system includes an n8n-style visual workflow builder.
17. Agents may contain their own internal workflows.
18. Workflows may recursively contain agents and sub-workflows.
19. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is treated as a first-class citizen.
20. High-risk external actions require strict permissions.

## Stage 1: Implementation Guardrails
21. Development will strictly follow the defined staged architecture.
22. Stage 1 implements no production code.

## Stage 2: Monorepo Architecture
23. ATLAS uses a monorepo structure orchestrated by `pnpm` for Node spaces and `uv`/`hatchling` for Python.
24. Python code is organized by logical domain package inside a single `python/atlas` workspace package to optimize for solo developer maintainability while preserving domain boundaries.
25. The backend explicitly starts as a modular monolith.
26. `apps/web` is the primary web application location.
27. `apps/api` is the future API application entry point.
28. Worker deployments are deferred.
29. Agent definitions are separate from runtime code.
30. Workflows are separate portable assets.
31. MCP integrations have a dedicated repository area (`mcp/`).
32. Infrastructure is isolated from application logic.
33. Package/dependency management is standardized (`pnpm`, `pyproject.toml`).
34. Unnecessary orchestration/build tools (e.g., Turborepo, Nx) are avoided initially to keep complexity low.

## Stage 3: Application Shell
35. ATLAS uses a persistent desktop application shell, avoiding traditional browser-level scrolling.
36. The Shell consists of Sidebar, TopBar, MainWorkspace, AgentDock, and BottomTaskbar.
37. Main module content scrolls independently from the application chrome within the MainWorkspace.
38. The Agent Dock is a global shell feature for tracking agent activity and executing autonomous workflows.
39. Bottom panel architecture is primed for Terminal, Tasks, Agents, Jobs, Alerts, and System features.
40. Shell visual preferences (Sidebar collapse, Dock open/width, active bottom panel) persist locally.
41. ATLAS remains inherently desktop-first in layout design.
42. Module pages are isolated and may request standard, dense, or full-bleed layouts (via container usage).
43. No business or domain logic belongs in the UI shell layer (e.g. market data ticker uses mock fixture pending Stage 17 integration).

## Stage 4: Navigation Architecture
44. ATLAS core navigation consists of exactly 20 modules defined in code (not a database).
45. Stable machine-readable module IDs and a canonical route structure are strictly enforced.
46. Module registry is the single source of truth for routing, icons, labels, aliases, and settings namespaces.
47. The Sidebar dynamically renders items directly from the central module registry to ensure absolute consistency.
48. Missing core modules render a clean `ModuleFoundation.tsx` page to avoid 404s and accurately reflect the future architecture.
49. Legacy/singular routes (e.g., `/screener`, `/economy`, `/map`, `/portfolio`, `/analytics`) are permanently redirected to their canonical plural/current equivalents (`/screeners`, `/economics`, `/maps`, `/portfolios`, `/risk`).
50. Shell surfaces like Agent Dock and ATLAS AI top-bar overlay are strictly separate concepts from the full `/agents` and `/ai` workstation modules.
51. Existing functionality (like the Home screen) is preserved, while foundation pages are injected seamlessly for the remaining unbuilt modules.
52. The root route `/` performs a permanent redirect to `/home`.
53. Future permissions, commands, and contexts will directly consume this established module registry.
